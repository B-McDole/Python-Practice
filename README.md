# Python-Practice

The entire purpose of this repo is to get people familiar with Python for use in a later repo, one on Neural Networks.
Much of this will seem silly and/or trivial if you are an experienced Python developer, and thus this is probably not for you!
But, if you are less experienced, or just want somewhere to start, then this is the place for you.
If things seem simple at first, then that's great!  They will be straightforward at first.  The foundation needs to be secure to build with confidence.
Everything in this repo will be created using Spyder, one of the IDE's included with Anaconda.  I would highly recommend downloading Anaconda for your data science work.  It will keep a nice stable environment, and also contains many of the librarys you will need. In order to get anaconda you can either use pip (if you have a mac, that's easy), or go here: https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#windows
One word of advice, just make note that you are recommended not to add Anaconda to your path (it can break some things).
Once you have Anaconda installed I would recommend opening the Anaconda prompt and checking for an update (conda update conda).
Then you should be good to go!

I tend to use Spyder, as I like the R layout.  If nothing else I love consistency.  Jupyter Notebooks are great too though!
In the past I have also used Pycharm, but it is a little powerful for what we need.
I also used IDLE, but I was too young to know better ;)

Oh, one other word, if you have admin rights you should go ahead and install VS Tools.  You will probably at some point need the compiler for some work (I needed it for a Cosine matching library).  You will need admin access though, so probably only do it on your own laptop.

If you have problems feel free to reach out to me and I will happily help out where I can!
